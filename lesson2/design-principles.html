            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
            <h1>Calm</h1>
            <a class="links" href="https://www.calm.com/"> Calm.com</a>
            <img src="wk2-img/calm.jpg" alt="Screen shot of Calm home web page, a mountain rang with a serene lake"></a>
            <p> Visual Hierarchy is the use of color and size to draw attention to important elements.
                The first thing you notice is the serene background photo. This sends a strong message to users with out
                words.
                It is also the largest object on the web page. The secondary focus is the contrasting white text that
                leads your eye to the smaller text.
                Lastly, they use the bolded font and bright blue color to create a button. Through size,
                font and colors you can see how hierarchy is used in design. </p>

            <h3>Hick's & Fitt's Law</h3>
            <h1>Oliver Jeffers</h1>
            <a class="links" href="https://www.oliverjeffers.com/">Oliverjeffers.com</a>
            <img src="wk2-img/oliverjeffers.jpg"
                alt="a man standin on green grass with a cloudy sky, large white fonted menu"></a>
            <p>Hickâ€™s Law says, "That every additional choice increases the time required to make a decision". On Oliver
                Jeffer's web page you can see how
                displaying only the navigation gives the user few options. These few options help users to take action
                quickly. This site also uses Fitt's Law, which says
                ,"The larger and closer and object is, the easier it is to use". Making a simple, large navigation bar
                creates a nice actionable page for all users.

            <h3>White Space & Clean Design</h3>
            <h1>Lululemon</h1>
            <a class="links" href="https://shop.lululemon.com/">Lululemon.com</a>
            <img src="wk2-img/lululemon.jpg"
                alt=" mobile version of lululemon homepage, a photo of a woman running"></a>
            <p>Simpliciy and White space are used on this site to create function and impact. The header, the search bar
                and the drop down menu are all white.
                This might seem like it would be boring. However, It allows many elements to be present and not
                overwhelming. The scrolling photo creates interest and contrast
                to the White top third of the page. The elements displayed are minimal and surrounded by white making it
                easy to understand. </p>
