        <h2>Get To Know Cozumel</h2>
        <p>The growth and decline of the Mayan civilization is an
             unforgettable part of the prehispanic history of Cozumel.
              Originally, the Mayans were established in Guatemala,
               fifteen centuries before Christ. Their culture and influence 
               then extended to the entire south: Mexico, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador.
                In 200 ac, they began to build cities in the Yucatan Peninsula.
<br>The advanced Mayan culture hit its peak from the VII century until the IX century. 
They considered Cozumel to be a sacred sanctuary and called it “Cuzaam Luumi” 
which means land or place of the swallows. They later shortened these two words to “Cuzamil”.
 When the Spanish arrived, the name adapted phonetically from “Cuzamil” to “Cozumel”.</p>
 <p>The first Spanish expedition to visit Cozumel was led by Juan de Grijalva on May 3rd, 
     1518 from Cuba. The following year Hernán Cortés stopped by the island on his way to Veracruz. 
     The Grijalva and Cortés expeditions were both received peacefully by the Maya of Cozumel, unlike
      other expeditions on the mainland. Even after Cortés destroyed some of the Maya idols on Cozumel 
      and replaced them with an image of the Virgin Mary, the native inhabitants of the island continued 
      to help the Spanish resupply their ships with food and water so they could continue their voyages.When 
      he left the island in 1530, the native civilization was in ruins. Unfortunately, one of the crew members of
       the ship had had smallpox, a disease that until this moment had not existed in America. The resulting epidemic 
       killed thousands.</p>
